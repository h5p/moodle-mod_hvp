# H5P Moodle Plugin

Create and add rich content inside your LMS for free. Some examples of what you
get with H5P are Interactive Video, Quizzes, Collage and Timeline.

## Usage

If you intend to use the repository directly in production, make sure that you're using the "Stable" branch, as this is the production branch.
There are no guarantees for the state of the other branches at any given time.
Also make sure that all submodules are pulled as well using:

```
git submodule update --init
```

## Description

One of the great benefits with using H5P is that it gives you access to lots of
different [interactive content types](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications).

Another great benefit with H5P is that it allows you to easily share and reuse
content. To reuse content, you just download the H5P you would like to edit and
make your changes â€“ e.g. translate to a new language or adjust it to a new
situation.

H5P is:

* Open Source
* Free to Use
* HTML5

The H5P community is actively contributing to improve H5P. Updates and new
features are continuously made available on the community portal
